### 5. Four Friends

Anna, Bartosz, Cezary, and Danuta are four friends. Each of them is preparing for a specific profession: archaeologist, bookkeeper, carpenter, and dentist. It is known that Bartosz will be a dentist. Only one of these people is training for a profession that starts with the same letter as their name, and that person is **not** Anna.

**What professions did Anna and Danuta choose?**

<ASSISTANT>
Alright, let's tackle this logic puzzle step by step. We have four friends: Anna, Bartosz, Cezary, and Danuta. Each is preparing for a distinct profession: archaeologist, bookkeeper, carpenter, and dentist. We're given a few key pieces of information:

1. **Bartosz will be a dentist.**
2. **Only one of these people is training for a profession that starts with the same letter as their name.**
3. **That person is not Anna.**

Our goal is to determine the professions of Anna and Danuta.

### Step 1: Assign Known Information

First, let's assign the known profession to Bartosz.

- **Bartosz:** Dentist

This leaves us with three professions to assign: archaeologist, bookkeeper, and carpenter.

### Step 2: Analyze the Second Clue

The second clue states that only one person has a profession that starts with the same letter as their name, and that person is not Anna.

Let's list the names and possible professions that start with the same letter:

- **Anna:** Archaeologist (both start with 'A')
- **Bartosz:** Bookkeeper (both start with 'B')
- **Cezary:** Carpenter (both start with 'C')
- **Danuta:** Dentist (both start with 'D')

However, we already know that Bartosz is the dentist, so Danuta cannot be the dentist. Therefore, the only possible person whose profession starts with the same letter as their name is:

- **Cezary:** Carpenter

This is because:

- Anna cannot be the one (as per the clue).
- Bartosz is already the dentist.
- Danuta cannot be the dentist (since Bartosz is).
- Therefore, Cezary must be the carpenter.

### Step 3: Assign Cezary's Profession

- **Cezary:** Carpenter

Now, we have two professions left: archaeologist and bookkeeper.

### Step 4: Determine Anna's Profession

Since Anna cannot be the one with a profession starting with 'A' (as per the clue), she cannot be the archaeologist. Therefore, Anna must be the bookkeeper.

- **Anna:** Bookkeeper

### Step 5: Assign Danuta's Profession

The only remaining profession is archaeologist.

- **Danuta:** Archaeologist

### Summary of Assignments

- **Anna:** Bookkeeper
- **Bartosz:** Dentist
- **Cezary:** Carpenter
- **Danuta:** Archaeologist

### Verification

Let's verify if all conditions are met:

1. **Bartosz is the dentist.** ✅
2. **Only one person has a profession starting with the same letter as their name.** Cezary is the carpenter. ✅
3. **That person is not Anna.** Cezary is not Anna. ✅

All conditions are satisfied with these assignments.

### Final Answer

- **Anna:** Bookkeeper
- **Danuta:** Archaeologist
