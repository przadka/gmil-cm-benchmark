### 1. Two Dates

Mateusz has 12 cards with digits:

`0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5`

and he arranges them to form dates. The first date of 2025 that he can create using two cards to form the day number, two other cards to form the month number, and four other cards to form the year number will be January 13:

`1 3 0 1 2 0 2 5`

**What will be the last date in 2025 that Mateusz can create using eight of these twelve cards?**

<ASSISTANT>
We start with the 12 cards containing
\[
\{0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5\}.
\]
Mateusz is making dates in the format DD MM YYYY by choosing **8** of these 12 cards. (The other 4 cards are left aside.) In every date he forms, the year is 2025. (In the “first date” example he used the cards \(1\,3\,0\,1\,2\,0\,2\,5\) to form January 13, 2025.)

Because the year must be 2025, its four digits are fixed as \(2\), \(0\), \(2\), and \(5\). (They can be arranged only as 2025 if we want the year 2025.) However, we must be careful: the 8 digits used in the date must come from the available multiset, so their overall frequency cannot exceed the available counts.

### Step 1. Determine the “Leftover” Pool for Day and Month

The full multiset is:
- 0 appears 2 times.
- 1 appears 2 times.
- 2 appears 2 times.
- 3 appears 2 times.
- 4 appears 2 times.
- 5 appears 2 times.

Since the year “2025” uses the digits \(2, 0, 2, 5\), their frequency usage is:
- Digit 2: used **2** times.
- Digit 0: used **1** time.
- Digit 5: used **1** time.

Subtracting these from the full counts, the remaining available cards for the day and month (which use 4 cards in total) are:
- 0: \(2-1=1\)
- 1: \(2\) (untouched)
- 2: \(2-2=0\) (no 2’s remain)
- 3: \(2\)
- 4: \(2\)
- 5: \(2-1=1\)

Thus, for day and month we may only use the digits from the multiset
\[
\{0\,(1),\, 1\,(2),\, 3\,(2),\, 4\,(2),\, 5\,(1)\}.
\]

### Step 2. What Months Are Possible?

The month is a two‐digit number between 01 and 12. Let’s see which can be formed using our available digits (remember, we have **no 2’s left**, so any month needing a digit “2” is impossible):

- **01:** Uses \(0\) and \(1\). (Possible.)
- **02:** Uses \(0\) and \(2\). (Impossible; no 2.)
- **03:** Uses \(0\) and \(3\). (Possible.)
- **04:** Uses \(0\) and \(4\). (Possible.)
- **05:** Uses \(0\) and \(5\). (Possible.)
- **06:** Would need a 6. (Not available.)
- **07:** Would need a 7.
- **08:** Would need an 8.
- **09:** Would need a 9.
- **10:** Uses \(1\) and \(0\). (Possible.)
- **11:** Uses \(1\) and \(1\). (Possible.)
- **12:** Uses \(1\) and \(2\). (Impossible; no 2.)

Thus the only months that can be formed are: **01, 03, 04, 05, 10,** and **11.**

Since we are looking for the *last* (i.e. the latest) date in 2025 that Mateusz can create, we want the date that occurs as late as possible in the year. This means we want the month as high as possible, and then within that month, the highest day number (subject to that month’s number of days).

Among our valid months, the largest (numerically) is **11** (November). (Note that even though December is later, “12” is impossible because it requires a 2.) 

### Step 3. Choose the Day for the Month

Now, for month **11** (November), we need a valid day. November has 30 days, so the day number must be between 01 and 30.

We must choose 2 digits for the day from our leftover pool after “using” the month digits. The pool before choosing the month digits is:
\[
\{0:1,\, 1:2,\, 3:2,\, 4:2,\, 5:1\}.
\]
For month 11, we use two 1’s. So subtracting those, the remaining pool for the day becomes:
\[
\{0:1,\, 1:0,\, 3:2,\, 4:2,\, 5:1\}.
\]
Now, we want the largest valid day (no greater than 30) that can be made from these digits.

Let’s consider the possibilities:
- The number **30** requires digits \(3\) and \(0\). Check the pool: 3 is available (we need one; we have 2) and 0 is available (we have 1). So we can form 30.
- Could we try 31? That would require \(3\) and \(1\). But we have no 1’s left in the day pool.
- Also, any day greater than 30 would be invalid in November anyway.

Thus the best (largest) day for November is **30**.

### Step 4. Verify the Entire Date

The date we have is:
- **Day:** 30 (digits: 3 and 0)
- **Month:** 11 (digits: 1 and 1)
- **Year:** 2025 (digits: 2, 0, 2, 5)

Let’s count all the digits used:
- **0:** from day: one \(0\); from month: none; from year: one \(0\). Total = 2.
- **1:** from day: none; from month: two \(1\)’s; from year: none. Total = 2.
- **2:** from year: two \(2\)’s. Total = 2.
- **3:** from day: one \(3\); Total = 1.
- **5:** from year: one \(5\). Total = 1.
- **4:** not used.

These counts do not exceed the available counts:
- 0 (2 available), 1 (2), 2 (2), 3 (2), 4 (2), 5 (2).

Thus, the date **30/11/2025** (30th November 2025) is valid and is the latest possible date in 2025 that Mateusz can form under the rules.

### Final Answer

The last date in 2025 that Mateusz can create using eight of these twelve cards is:

\[
\boxed{30\,11\,2025.}
\]
