### 2. Aquarium
In the aquarium, there are octopuses with eight arms and starfish with five arms.
**How many starfish are there in the aquarium if the total number of arms of all the animals living in it is 41?**

<ASSISTANT>
Let me solve this step by step.

First, let me write out the constraints from the puzzle:
1. There are octopuses (8 arms each) and starfish (5 arms each)
2. The total number of arms is 41
3. We need to find the number of starfish

Let's solve:
1. Let's say there are 'x' starfish
2. Then let's say there are 'y' octopuses
3. We can write an equation:
   * 5x + 8y = 41 (where x = number of starfish, y = number of octopuses)
4. Since we're dealing with whole animals, both x and y must be non-negative integers
5. Let's try some values:
   * If y = 1: 5x + 8 = 41
   * Then 5x = 33
   * x = 6.6 - this is not possible as we can't have partial starfish
   * If y = 2: 5x + 16 = 41
   * Then 5x = 25
   * x = 5 - this works!
6. We can verify:
   * 5 starfish × 5 arms = 25 arms
   * 2 octopuses × 8 arms = 16 arms
   * Total: 25 + 16 = 41 arms

Therefore, there are 5 starfish in the aquarium.

Let me double-check: Is there another possible solution?
* If y = 3: 5x + 24 = 41, so 5x = 17, x = 3.4 (impossible)
* If y = 0: 5x = 41, x = 8.2 (impossible)
* If y > 3: The octopus arms alone would exceed 41

So 5 starfish is the only possible solution.
