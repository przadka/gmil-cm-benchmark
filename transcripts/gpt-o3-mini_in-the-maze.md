### 3. In the Maze

In the maze, the rooms are numbered from 0 to 15. Moving between rooms triggers an alarm, except when:

- Moving to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than the current room, or  
- Moving to a room with a number exactly 13 less than the current room.

We enter the maze through room number 0 and exit through room number 1.

**How many rooms will we pass through (including rooms 0 and 1) if we never trigger the alarm along the way?**

#### Maze Layout:

```
9   12  15   2
6    7   4   5
3   10  11   8
0   13  14   1
```

<ASSISTANT>
We are only allowed to move in one of two ways:

- **Add 3:** Move from room \(X\) to room \(X+3\).
- **Subtract 13:** Move from room \(X\) to room \(X-13\).

However, the move is only permitted if the resulting room number is between 0 and 15 (inclusive).

### Step-by-Step Path

1. **Start at Room 0:**  
   Allowed move: \(0 + 3 = 3\).  
   **Path so far:** 0 → 3

2. **From Room 3:**  
   Allowed move: \(3 + 3 = 6\).  
   **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6

3. **From Room 6:**  
   Allowed move: \(6 + 3 = 9\).  
   **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6 → 9

4. **From Room 9:**  
   Allowed move: \(9 + 3 = 12\).  
   **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 12

5. **From Room 12:**  
   Allowed move: \(12 + 3 = 15\).  
   **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15

6. **From Room 15:**  
   The \(+3\) move would give 18, which is out of range, so we must use the \(-13\) move:  
   \(15 - 13 = 2\).  
   **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15 → 2

7. **From Room 2:**  
   Allowed move: \(2 + 3 = 5\).  
   **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15 → 2 → 5

8. **From Room 5:**  
   Allowed move: \(5 + 3 = 8\).  
   **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15 → 2 → 5 → 8

9. **From Room 8:**  
   Allowed move: \(8 + 3 = 11\).  
   **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 11

10. **From Room 11:**  
    Allowed move: \(11 + 3 = 14\).  
    **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 11 → 14

11. **From Room 14:**  
    The \(+3\) move would give 17 (invalid), so we use the \(-13\) move:  
    \(14 - 13 = 1\) (the exit room).  
    **Path:** 0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 11 → 14 → 1

### Count the Rooms

Including both the starting room (0) and the exit room (1), the path passes through:

\[
12 \text{ rooms.}
\]

Thus, if we never trigger the alarm, we will pass through **12 rooms**.
