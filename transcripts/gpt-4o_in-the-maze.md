### 3. In the Maze

In the maze, the rooms are numbered from 0 to 15. Moving between rooms triggers an alarm, except when:

- Moving to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than the current room, or  
- Moving to a room with a number exactly 13 less than the current room.

We enter the maze through room number 0 and exit through room number 1.

**How many rooms will we pass through (including rooms 0 and 1) if we never trigger the alarm along the way?**

#### Maze Layout:

```
9   12  15   2
6    7   4   5
3   10  11   8
0   13  14   1
```

To solve this, we'll identify the sequence of rooms starting from room **0** and ending at room **1**, while following the rules that prevent triggering the alarm:

### **Allowed Moves:**
1. Move to a room **exactly 3 greater** than the current room.
2. Move to a room **exactly 13 less** than the current room.

### **Step-by-step Pathfinding:**

- **Starting Room: 0**
  - Move to **0 + 3 = 3** (valid move, no alarm).
- From **3**, move to **3 + 3 = 6** (valid).
- From **6**, move to **6 + 3 = 9** (valid).
- From **9**, move to **9 + 3 = 12** (valid).
- From **12**, move to **12 + 3 = 15** (valid).
- From **15**, move to **15 - 13 = 2** (valid).
- From **2**, move to **2 + 3 = 5** (valid).
- From **5**, move to **5 + 3 = 8** (valid).
- From **8**, move to **8 + 3 = 11** (valid).
- From **11**, move to **11 + 3 = 14** (valid).
- From **14**, move to **14 - 13 = 1** (valid).

### **Rooms Visited:**
0 → 3 → 6 → 9 → 12 → 15 → 2 → 5 → 8 → 11 → 14 → 1

This path includes **12 rooms** in total.

**Final Answer:** ✅ **12 rooms** (including rooms 0 and 1).
