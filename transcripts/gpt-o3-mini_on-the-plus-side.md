### 7. On the Plus Side

X X X X X X

Place all the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 in the boxes in such a way that the first number is smaller than the last, and in every set of three consecutive boxes, there are two numbers and their sum.

<ASSISTANT>
We will show that there is essentially one way to place the numbers 
\[
1,\;2,\;3,\;4,\;5,\;7
\]
in six boxes

\[
\boxed{\,}\;\boxed{\,}\;\boxed{\,}\;\boxed{\,}\;\boxed{\,}\;\boxed{\,}
\]
so that

1. The first number is smaller than the last.
2. In every set of three consecutive boxes, one of the three equals the sum of the other two.

In any three positive numbers where one is the sum of the other two, that “sum‐number” must be the largest. (For example, if \(1+3=4\) then \(4\) is larger than both \(1\) and \(3\).) Thus in every triple of consecutive boxes the largest of the three must equal the sum of the other two.

One successful solution is
\[
\boxed{4}\;\boxed{1}\;\boxed{3}\;\boxed{2}\;\boxed{5}\;\boxed{7}\,.
\]
Let’s check that this works.

### Checking the Conditions

Label the boxes as positions \(a,b,c,d,e,f\) with:
\[
a=4,\quad b=1,\quad c=3,\quad d=2,\quad e=5,\quad f=7.
\]
1. **First vs. Last:** We have \(a=4<f=7\) so the first number is smaller than the last.

2. **Triple Sums:**
   - **Triple 1:** \(a,b,c = (4,1,3)\).  
     The maximum is \(4\) and indeed \(1+3=4\).
   - **Triple 2:** \(b,c,d = (1,3,2)\).  
     The maximum is \(3\) and \(1+2=3\).
   - **Triple 3:** \(c,d,e = (3,2,5)\).  
     The maximum is \(5\) and \(3+2=5\).
   - **Triple 4:** \(d,e,f = (2,5,7)\).  
     The maximum is \(7\) and \(2+5=7\).

Since every set of three consecutive boxes has the property that the largest equals the sum of the other two, all conditions are met.

### A Brief Look at How One Might Find This

One way to attack the problem is as follows:

1. **Work with Overlapping Triples.**  
   Denote the boxes by \(a,b,c,d,e,f\). The three‐box groups are:
   - \(a,b,c\)
   - \(b,c,d\)
   - \(c,d,e\)
   - \(d,e,f\).

2. **Use the “Sum Equals Largest” Rule.**  
   In each triple the largest number must equal the sum of the other two. For instance, if the first three boxes contain numbers \(4,1,3\) then the only possibility (up to reordering) is that \(4=1+3\).

3. **Make a Choice that “Propagates”.**  
   One may try to choose a triple for \(a,b,c\) that uses numbers which “mesh” well with a choice for \(b,c,d\). In our solution we eventually found that taking 
   \[
   (a,b,c)=(4,1,3)
   \]
   worked nicely because then the next triple \(b,c,d=(1,3,d)\) forces
   \[
   1+3=d\quad\Longrightarrow\quad d=4,
   \]
   but \(4\) is already used! So that ordering does not work. (In our search we must be careful not to “reuse” a number.)  
   
   After some experimenting with different orders and noting that the three‐box groups overlap, one finds that the following ordering works:
   - Choose \((a,b,c)=(4,1,3)\) (here the triple works because \(1+3=4\)).
   - Then in \((b,c,d)=(1,3,d)\) the only possibility is to have the maximum be \(3\) or \(d\). But if \(3\) is the maximum then we’d need \(1+d=3\) (so \(d=2\)) – and that is acceptable if it does not conflict later.
   - Continuing, \((c,d,e)=(3,2,e)\) forces \(3+2=5\) (so \(e=5\)).
   - Finally, \((d,e,f)=(2,5,f)\) forces \(2+5=7\) (so \(f=7\)).
   - Finally, check \(a<f\) (i.e. \(4<7\)).

Thus, the only solution (up to the ordering within each triple that does not violate the overlaps and the distinctness of numbers) is
\[
\boxed{4}\;\boxed{1}\;\boxed{3}\;\boxed{2}\;\boxed{5}\;\boxed{7}\,.
\]

### Final Answer

One acceptable answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}\quad \boxed{1}\quad \boxed{3}\quad \boxed{2}\quad \boxed{5}\quad \boxed{7}.
\]

This arrangement satisfies that the first number (4) is less than the last (7) and that in each group of three consecutive boxes one number equals the sum of the other two.
