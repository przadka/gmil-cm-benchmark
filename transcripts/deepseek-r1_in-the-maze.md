### 3. In the Maze

In the maze, the rooms are numbered from 0 to 15. Moving between rooms triggers an alarm, except when:

- Moving to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than the current room, or  
- Moving to a room with a number exactly 13 less than the current room.

We enter the maze through room number 0 and exit through room number 1.

**How many rooms will we pass through (including rooms 0 and 1) if we never trigger the alarm along the way?**

#### Maze Layout:

```
9   12  15   2
6    7   4   5
3   10  11   8
0   13  14   1
```

<ASSISTANT>
To solve the problem of navigating through the maze without triggering the alarm, we need to carefully analyze the movement rules and the layout of the maze. Here's a step-by-step approach to determine the number of rooms we'll pass through from room 0 to room 1 without setting off the alarm.

### Understanding the Movement Rules

1. **Allowed Moves:**
   - **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than the current room.**
   - **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than the current room.**

2. **Constraints:**
   - **Cannot move to any other rooms without triggering the alarm.**
   - **Start at room 0 and exit at room 1.**

### Analyzing the Maze Layout

The maze is a 4x4 grid with rooms numbered from 0 to 15:

```
9   12  15   2
6    7   4   5
3   10  11   8
0   13  14   1
```

We can represent this grid with their respective room numbers for clarity:

```
(0,0)=9  (0,1)=12  (0,2)=15  (0,3)=2
(1,0)=6  (1,1)=7   (1,2)=4   (1,3)=5
(2,0)=3  (2,1)=10  (2,2)=11  (2,3)=8
(3,0)=0  (3,1)=13  (3,2)=14  (3,3)=1
```

Here, the first number in the parentheses represents the row, and the second represents the column, starting from (0,0) at the top-left corner.

### Mapping Possible Moves

Starting at room 0 (located at (3,0)), we need to find a path to room 1 (located at (3,3)) using only the allowed moves.

**Allowed Moves from Room 0:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 0:**
   - 0 + 3 = 3
   - Room 3 is located at (2,0).

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 0:**
   - 0 - 13 = -13
   - Room -13 does not exist in the maze.

Therefore, from room 0, the only possible move is to room 3.

**Next, from Room 3:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 3:**
   - 3 + 3 = 6
   - Room 6 is located at (1,0).

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 3:**
   - 3 - 13 = -10
   - Room -10 does not exist in the maze.

So, from room 3, the only possible move is to room 6.

**Continuing from Room 6:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 6:**
   - 6 + 3 = 9
   - Room 9 is located at (0,0).

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 6:**
   - 6 - 13 = -7
   - Room -7 does not exist in the maze.

Thus, from room 6, the only possible move is to room 9.

**Proceeding from Room 9:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 9:**
   - 9 + 3 = 12
   - Room 12 is located at (0,1).

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 9:**
   - 9 - 13 = -4
   - Room -4 does not exist in the maze.

Therefore, from room 9, the only possible move is to room 12.

**Next, from Room 12:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 12:**
   - 12 + 3 = 15
   - Room 15 is located at (0,2).

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 12:**
   - 12 - 13 = -1
   - Room -1 does not exist in the maze.

So, from room 12, the only possible move is to room 15.

**Continuing from Room 15:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 15:**
   - 15 + 3 = 18
   - Room 18 does not exist in the maze.

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 15:**
   - 15 - 13 = 2
   - Room 2 is located at (0,3).

Thus, from room 15, the only possible move is to room 2.

**Proceeding from Room 2:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 2:**
   - 2 + 3 = 5
   - Room 5 is located at (1,3).

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 2:**
   - 2 - 13 = -11
   - Room -11 does not exist in the maze.

Therefore, from room 2, the only possible move is to room 5.

**Next, from Room 5:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 5:**
   - 5 + 3 = 8
   - Room 8 is located at (2,3).

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 5:**
   - 5 - 13 = -8
   - Room -8 does not exist in the maze.

So, from room 5, the only possible move is to room 8.

**Continuing from Room 8:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 8:**
   - 8 + 3 = 11
   - Room 11 is located at (2,2).

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 8:**
   - 8 - 13 = -5
   - Room -5 does not exist in the maze.

Thus, from room 8, the only possible move is to room 11.

**Proceeding from Room 11:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 11:**
   - 11 + 3 = 14
   - Room 14 is located at (3,2).

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 11:**
   - 11 - 13 = -2
   - Room -2 does not exist in the maze.

Therefore, from room 11, the only possible move is to room 14.

**Next, from Room 14:**

1. **Move to a room with a number exactly 3 greater than 14:**
   - 14 + 3 = 17
   - Room 17 does not exist in the maze.

2. **Move to a room with a number exactly 13 less than 14:**
   - 14 - 13 = 1
   - Room 1 is located at (3,3).

Thus, from room 14, the only possible move is to room 1, which is our exit.

### Summarizing the Path

Let's list out the sequence of rooms we pass through:

1. **Room 0** (Start)
2. **Room 3**
3. **Room 6**
4. **Room 9**
5. **Room 12**
6. **Room 15**
7. **Room 2**
8. **Room 5**
9. **Room 8**
10. **Room 11**
11. **Room 14**
12. **Room 1** (Exit)

### Counting the Number of Rooms

Counting each room in the sequence:

1. Room 0
2. Room 3
3. Room 6
4. Room 9
5. Room 12
6. Room 15
7. Room 2
8. Room 5
9. Room 8
10. Room 11
11. Room 14
12. Room 1

This totals **12 rooms** passed through, including both the starting room (0) and the exit room (1).

### Verifying the Path

To ensure that this path is valid and that no alarms are triggered, let's verify each move:

- **0 → 3:** 3 is exactly 3 greater than 0. **Valid.**
- **3 → 6:** 6 is exactly 3 greater than 3. **Valid.**
- **6 → 9:** 9 is exactly 3 greater than 6. **Valid.**
- **9 → 12:** 12 is exactly 3 greater than 9. **Valid.**
- **12 → 15:** 15 is exactly 3 greater than 12. **Valid.**
- **15 → 2:** 2 is exactly 13 less than 15 (15 - 13 = 2). **Valid.**
- **2 → 5:** 5 is exactly 3 greater than 2. **Valid.**
- **5 → 8:** 8 is exactly 3 greater than 5. **Valid.**
- **8 → 11:** 11 is exactly 3 greater than 8. **Valid.**
- **11 → 14:** 14 is exactly 3 greater than 11. **Valid.**
- **14 → 1:** 1 is exactly 13 less than 14 (14 - 13 = 1). **Valid.**

All moves adhere to the movement rules, and no alarms are triggered during the journey.

### Conclusion

By systematically analyzing each possible move and ensuring that each transition complies with the given rules, we've determined that the shortest path from room 0 to room 1 without triggering the alarm passes through **12 rooms**. This includes both the starting and ending rooms.

**Final Answer:** We will pass through **12 rooms** in total, including rooms 0 and 1, without triggering the alarm.
