### 4. Race to 2025!

```
   G N A J
+     N A
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

In this coded addition, different letters represent different digits, and the same digit is always represented by the same letter. Additionally, none of the multi-digit numbers start with zero.

**What is the value of NA?**

### Understanding the Problem

We are given a cryptarithmetic puzzle:

```
   G N A J
+     N A
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

Each letter represents a unique digit (0-9), and the same letter represents the same digit throughout the puzzle. Additionally, multi-digit numbers cannot start with zero. Our goal is to find the value of "NA," which is a two-digit number formed by the digits represented by N and A.

### Breaking Down the Puzzle

Let's represent the addition vertically to better visualize the place values:

```
   G N A J
+     N A
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

This can be rewritten as:

```
   G N A J
+     0 N A
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

Here, we've added a leading zero to "NA" to align the digits properly for addition.

### Analyzing the Units Place (J + A = 5 or 15)

Starting from the rightmost digit (units place):

- **J + A = 5** or **J + A = 15** (if there's a carryover from the addition of the tens place).

Since the sum in the units place is 5, and considering that J and A are single digits, the possible scenarios are:

1. **J + A = 5** (no carryover)
2. **J + A = 15** (with a carryover of 1 to the next column)

We'll explore both possibilities.

### Exploring Possibility 1: J + A = 5 (No Carryover)

If there's no carryover, then:

- **J + A = 5**

Let's list the possible pairs for (J, A):

- (0, 5)
- (1, 4)
- (2, 3)
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)
- (5, 0)

However, since "NA" is a two-digit number, N cannot be zero. Therefore, A cannot be zero because that would make "NA" a number starting with zero, which is not allowed.

So, we eliminate (5, 0) from the list.

Remaining possible pairs:

- (0, 5)
- (1, 4)
- (2, 3)
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)

### Moving to the Tens Place (A + N + carryover = 2 or 12)

Next, we examine the tens place:

- **A + N + carryover = 2** or **12** (if there's a carryover from the units place)

Since we're assuming no carryover from the units place (J + A = 5), the equation simplifies to:

- **A + N = 2** or **A + N = 12**

Given that A and N are digits from 0 to 9, and considering that N cannot be zero (as "NA" is a two-digit number), let's analyze both cases.

#### Case 1: A + N = 2

Possible pairs for (A, N):

- (0, 2)
- (1, 1)

But A cannot be zero (as established earlier), and digits must be unique, so (1, 1) is invalid because A and N would be the same digit.

Thus, no valid pairs in this case.

#### Case 2: A + N = 12

Possible pairs for (A, N):

- (3, 9)
- (4, 8)
- (5, 7)
- (6, 6)
- (7, 5)
- (8, 4)
- (9, 3)

Again, digits must be unique, so we eliminate (6, 6).

Remaining possible pairs:

- (3, 9)
- (4, 8)
- (5, 7)
- (7, 5)
- (8, 4)
- (9, 3)

Now, let's cross-reference these with the possible (J, A) pairs from the units place.

From earlier, possible (J, A) pairs:

- (0, 5)
- (1, 4)
- (2, 3)
- (3, 2)
- (4, 1)

We need to find overlapping A values between the two lists.

Looking at the (A, N) pairs:

- (3, 9): A = 3
- (4, 8): A = 4
- (5, 7): A = 5
- (7, 5): A = 7
- (8, 4): A = 8
- (9, 3): A = 9

Now, check which of these A values appear in the (J, A) pairs:

- A = 3: Present in (2, 3)
- A = 4: Present in (1, 4)
- A = 5: Present in (0, 5)
- A = 7: Not present in (J, A) pairs
- A = 8: Not present in (J, A) pairs
- A = 9: Not present in (J, A) pairs

So, the overlapping (A, N) pairs are:

- (3, 9)
- (4, 8)
- (5, 7)

Now, let's list the corresponding (J, A) pairs:

1. **A = 3**: (J, A) = (2, 3)
   - So, J = 2, A = 3, N = 9

2. **A = 4**: (J, A) = (1, 4)
   - So, J = 1, A = 4, N = 8

3. **A = 5**: (J, A) = (0, 5)
   - So, J = 0, A = 5, N = 7

Now, we have three potential sets of values:

1. **Set 1**: J = 2, A = 3, N = 9
2. **Set 2**: J = 1, A = 4, N = 8
3. **Set 3**: J = 0, A = 5, N = 7

We'll evaluate each set to see if they satisfy the entire addition.

### Evaluating Set 1: J = 2, A = 3, N = 9

Let's substitute these values into the original addition:

```
   G N A J   => G 9 3 2
+     0 N A  =>   0 9 3
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

Now, perform the addition:

```
   G 9 3 2
+     0 9 3
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

Let's add column by column from right to left:

1. **Units place**: 2 (from G932) + 3 (from 093) = 5
   - This matches the units digit of 2025.

2. **Tens place**: 3 (from G932) + 9 (from 093) = 12
   - Write down 2 and carry over 1.

3. **Hundreds place**: 9 (from G932) + 0 (from 093) + 1 (carryover) = 10
   - Write down 0 and carry over 1.

4. **Thousands place**: G (from G932) + 0 (from 093) + 1 (carryover) = G + 1
   - This should equal 2 (from 2025).

So, G + 1 = 2 => G = 1

Now, let's check if all digits are unique:

- G = 1
- N = 9
- A = 3
- J = 2

All digits are unique and none of the multi-digit numbers start with zero. This set satisfies all conditions.

### Evaluating Set 2: J = 1, A = 4, N = 8

Substitute these values:

```
   G N A J   => G 8 4 1
+     0 N A  =>   0 8 4
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

Perform the addition:

```
   G 8 4 1
+     0 8 4
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

Adding column by column:

1. **Units place**: 1 + 4 = 5
   - Matches the units digit of 2025.

2. **Tens place**: 4 + 8 = 12
   - Write down 2 and carry over 1.

3. **Hundreds place**: 8 + 0 + 1 (carryover) = 9
   - But the hundreds digit in 2025 is 0, so this doesn't match.

Since the hundreds digit doesn't match, this set is invalid.

### Evaluating Set 3: J = 0, A = 5, N = 7

Substitute these values:

```
   G N A J   => G 7 5 0
+     0 N A  =>   0 7 5
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

Perform the addition:

```
   G 7 5 0
+     0 7 5
-----------
   2 0 2 5
```

Adding column by column:

1. **Units place**: 0 + 5 = 5
   - Matches the units digit of 2025.

2. **Tens place**: 5 + 7 = 12
   - Write down 2 and carry over 1.

3. **Hundreds place**: 7 + 0 + 1 (carryover) = 8
   - But the hundreds digit in 2025 is 0, so this doesn't match.

Since the hundreds digit doesn't match, this set is invalid.

### Conclusion

After evaluating all three possible sets, only **Set 1** satisfies all the conditions of the puzzle:

- **G = 1**
- **N = 9**
- **A = 3**
- **J = 2**

Therefore, the value of "NA" is **93**.

### Final Answer

The value of **NA** is **93**.
