### 1. Two Dates

Mateusz has 12 cards with digits:

`0 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5`

and he arranges them to form dates. The first date of 2025 that he can create using two cards to form the day number, two other cards to form the month number, and four other cards to form the year number will be January 13:

`1 3 0 1 2 0 2 5`

**What will be the last date in 2025 that Mateusz can create using eight of these twelve cards?**

<ASSISTANT>
To determine the last date in 2025 that Mateusz can create using eight of his twelve cards, we need to systematically analyze the constraints and possibilities. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:

### Understanding the Problem

Mateusz has 12 cards with the following digits:

`0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5`

He uses these cards to form dates in the format `DD MM YYYY`, where:

- **DD** represents the day (2 digits)
- **MM** represents the month (2 digits)
- **YYYY** represents the year (4 digits)

Our goal is to find the **last possible date** in the year 2025 that can be formed using **eight** of these twelve cards. This means we need to:

1. **Identify the latest possible date** in 2025.
2. **Ensure** that the date can be formed using the available digits without reusing any card more than its available count.

### Step 1: Identifying the Latest Possible Date in 2025

The latest date in any year is December 31. Therefore, we'll start by checking if `31 12 2025` can be formed with the given digits.

### Step 2: Checking the Availability of Digits for December 31, 2025

Let's list out the digits required for `31 12 2025`:

- **Day (DD):** `3` and `1`
- **Month (MM):** `1` and `2`
- **Year (YYYY):** `2`, `0`, `2`, `5`

Now, let's count the required digits:

- `3`: 1
- `1`: 2 (for day and month)
- `2`: 3 (for month and year)
- `0`: 1
- `5`: 1

Now, let's compare this with the available digits:

- `0`: 2 available
- `1`: 2 available
- `2`: 2 available
- `3`: 2 available
- `4`: 2 available
- `5`: 2 available

**Issue Identified:**

We need three `2`s (for the month and year), but only two `2`s are available. Therefore, `31 12 2025` cannot be formed with the given digits.

### Step 3: Finding the Next Latest Possible Date

Since December 31 is not possible, we'll move to the previous day, December 30 (`30 12 2025`), and check if it can be formed.

**Digits Required for December 30, 2025:**

- **Day (DD):** `3` and `0`
- **Month (MM):** `1` and `2`
- **Year (YYYY):** `2`, `0`, `2`, `5`

**Digit Count:**

- `3`: 1
- `0`: 2
- `1`: 1
- `2`: 3
- `5`: 1

**Comparison with Available Digits:**

- `0`: 2 available (matches)
- `1`: 2 available (only 1 needed)
- `2`: 2 available (need 3)
- `3`: 2 available (only 1 needed)
- `5`: 2 available (only 1 needed)

**Issue Identified:**

Again, we need three `2`s, but only two are available. Therefore, December 30 is also not possible.

### Step 4: Continuing to Earlier Dates

We'll continue this process, moving to earlier dates until we find a date that can be formed with the available digits.

**Next Date: December 29 (`29 12 2025`)**

**Digits Required:**

- **Day (DD):** `2` and `9`

**Conclusion:**

All required digits are available within the limits. Therefore, November 30, 2025, can be formed using the available cards.

### Final Answer

The last date in 2025 that Mateusz can create using eight of his twelve cards is **November 30, 2025**. The arrangement of the digits would be:

- **Day (DD):** `3` and `0`
- **Month (MM):** `1` and `1`
- **Year (YYYY):** `2`, `0`, `2`, `5`

This uses the digits `0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5`, which are all available within the given set of cards.
