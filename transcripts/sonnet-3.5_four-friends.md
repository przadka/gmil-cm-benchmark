### 5. Four Friends
Anna, Bartosz, Cezary, and Danuta are four friends. Each of them is preparing for a specific profession: archaeologist, bookkeeper, carpenter, and dentist. It is known that Bartosz will be a dentist. Only one of these people is training for a profession that starts with the same letter as their name, and that person is **not** Anna.
**What professions did Anna and Danuta choose?**

<ASSISTANT>
Let me solve this step by step by identifying the given constraints and logical deductions.

Constraints from the puzzle:
* There are 4 friends: Anna, Bartosz, Cezary, and Danuta
* The 4 professions are: archaeologist, bookkeeper, carpenter, and dentist
* Bartosz will be a dentist
* Only one person's profession starts with the same letter as their name
* Anna's profession does NOT start with 'A'

Let's solve:

1. We know Bartosz is a dentist, so that profession is taken.

2. Only one person has a profession starting with their name's first letter, and it's not Anna. Looking at the remaining people:
   * Cezary could be carpenter
   * Danuta could be dentist (but we know Bartosz is the dentist)
   * So Cezary must be the one whose profession starts with the same letter as their name - they must be the carpenter

3. Now we know:
   * Bartosz → dentist
   * Cezary → carpenter
   * Anna → not archaeologist (given)
   * Danuta → remaining profession

4. The remaining professions are:
   * archaeologist
   * bookkeeper

5. Since Anna cannot be an archaeologist, she must be the bookkeeper.
   Therefore, Danuta must be the archaeologist.

Answer: Anna will be a bookkeeper, and Danuta will be an archaeologist.
