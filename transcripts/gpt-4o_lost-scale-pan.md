## 6. The Lost Scale Pan

Robert lost the right pan of his balance scale and had to use a different one — slightly heavier than the original. Now, with empty pans, his scale does not show balance.

However, Robert noticed that when he places a full bottle of juice on the right pan and 9 identical empty bottles on the left pan, the scale is balanced.

The same happens when Robert places two empty bottles on the right pan and a bottle filled halfway with juice on the left pan.

**How many times heavier is the full bottle of juice compared to an empty bottle?**

<ASSISTANT>
Let’s define the variables:

- \( J \) = weight of the juice in a full bottle
- \( B \) = weight of an empty bottle
- \( D \) = difference in weight between the new, heavier right pan and the original right pan (since the scale is unbalanced when empty)

### First Condition:
When Robert places a full bottle of juice on the right pan and 9 empty bottles on the left pan, the scale balances.

\[
J + B + D = 9B
\]

Simplifying:

\[
J + D = 8B \quad (1)
\]

### Second Condition:
When Robert places two empty bottles on the right pan and a bottle filled halfway with juice on the left pan, the scale balances.

\[
2B + D = B + \frac{J}{2} \quad (2)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
B + D = \frac{J}{2} \quad (2')
\]

### Solving the System of Equations:
From equation (2’):

\[
D = \frac{J}{2} - B
\]

Substitute this into equation (1):

\[
J + \left( \frac{J}{2} - B \right) = 8B
\]

Simplify:

\[
J + \frac{J}{2} - B = 8B
\]
\[
\frac{3J}{2} = 9B
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
3J = 18B
\]

Solve for \( J \):

\[
J = 6B
\]

### Final Answer:
The full bottle of juice is **6 times heavier** than an empty bottle.
