### 5. Four Friends

Anna, Bartosz, Cezary, and Danuta are four friends. Each of them is preparing for a specific profession: archaeologist, bookkeeper, carpenter, and dentist. It is known that Bartosz will be a dentist. Only one of these people is training for a profession that starts with the same letter as their name, and that person is **not** Anna.

**What professions did Anna and Danuta choose?**

<ASSISTANT>
We are given four friends and four professions:

- **Friends:** Anna, Bartosz, Cezary, Danuta.
- **Professions:** archaeologist, bookkeeper, carpenter, dentist.

The information provided is:
1. **Bartosz will be a dentist.**
2. **Only one person’s profession starts with the same letter as their name, and that person is not Anna.**

Let’s analyze the possibilities:

### Step 1. Identify the Possible “Letter-Matching” Cases

A profession “matches” a friend if the initial of the friend’s name is the same as the initial of the profession.

- **Anna:** Could match if she were an **archaeologist** (A vs. A).
- **Bartosz:** Would match if he were a **bookkeeper** (B vs. B), but we know he is a dentist.
- **Cezary:** Would match if he were a **carpenter** (C vs. C).
- **Danuta:** Would match if she were a **dentist** (D vs. D), but dentist is taken by Bartosz.

Thus, the only possibilities for a matching pair are:
- Anna as archaeologist, or
- Cezary as carpenter.

### Step 2. Apply the Clue About Only One Matching and It’s Not Anna

The clue states that **only one person** has a matching initial, and that person is **not Anna**.  
- If Anna were an archaeologist, she would be the matching case. That would violate the condition because the matching person cannot be Anna.
- Therefore, **Anna cannot be the archaeologist**.

Thus, the matching case must be **Cezary as a carpenter**.

### Step 3. Determine the Professions for Anna and Danuta

So far, we have:
- **Bartosz:** Dentist (given).
- **Cezary:** Carpenter (to satisfy the matching condition).

That leaves the two remaining professions: **archaeologist** and **bookkeeper** for Anna and Danuta.

Since Anna cannot be archaeologist (because that would be a match for her), she must be the **bookkeeper**.  
That means Danuta must be the **archaeologist**.

### Final Answer

- **Anna** is the **bookkeeper**.
- **Danuta** is the **archaeologist**.
