### 5. Four Friends

Anna, Bartosz, Cezary, and Danuta are four friends. Each of them is preparing for a specific profession: archaeologist, bookkeeper, carpenter, and dentist. It is known that Bartosz will be a dentist. Only one of these people is training for a profession that starts with the same letter as their name, and that person is **not** Anna.

**What professions did Anna and Danuta choose?**

<ASSISTANT>
Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Bartosz will be a dentist.**  
   This is explicitly stated.

2. **Only one person is training for a profession that starts with the same letter as their name.**  
   The professions are:
   - **Archaeologist** (starts with A)
   - **Bookkeeper** (starts with B)
   - **Carpenter** (starts with C)
   - **Dentist** (starts with D)

3. **That person is not Anna.**  
   So, Anna is **not** an archaeologist.

Since Bartosz is already a dentist, he is **not** the person whose profession starts with the same letter as their name (Dentist starts with D, not B).

This means **either Cezary or Danuta** must have a profession that matches the first letter of their name.

- If **Cezary** is the **Carpenter**, that satisfies the condition.
- That leaves **Danuta** to be the **Bookkeeper**, and **Anna** would be the **Archaeologist**.

**But wait!** This contradicts the rule that Anna is **not** the person whose profession starts with the same letter as their name. However, in this arrangement, Anna is an archaeologist, which starts with A.

So, this arrangement is **not valid**.

Let's try the other possibility:

- If **Danuta** is the **Dentist**, this contradicts the given fact that Bartosz is the dentist. So that’s not possible.

Alternatively, what if **Danuta** is the **Bookkeeper** (matching D with Dentist is not applicable here, as Bartosz is the dentist)?  
Then **Cezary** would be the **Carpenter**, which starts with C — matching his name. This satisfies the condition.

Therefore, the correct arrangement is:

- **Bartosz** — Dentist  
- **Cezary** — Carpenter (matching profession)  
- **Danuta** — Bookkeeper  
- **Anna** — Archaeologist

So, **Anna is an archaeologist**, and **Danuta is a bookkeeper**.
