### 7. On the Plus Side
X X X X X X
Place all the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 in the boxes in such a way that the first number is smaller than the last, and in every set of three consecutive boxes, there are two numbers and their sum.

<ASSISTANT>
Let me break down the constraints from this puzzle by quoting them from your message and then solve it step by step:

1. "Place all the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7" - We must use each of these numbers exactly once
2. "in such a way that the first number is smaller than the last" - If we call the boxes a1 through a6, then a1 < a6
3. "in every set of three consecutive boxes, there are two numbers and their sum" - For positions (1,2,3), (2,3,4), (3,4,5), and (4,5,6), if we have numbers x,y,z in consecutive positions, then one of them must be the sum of the other two

Let me solve this step by step:

1. First, notice that 7 is the largest number. Any sum involving 7 would be at least 8, which is larger than any available number. This means 7 can only be used as a sum, not as one of the addends.

2. Since the first number must be smaller than the last, and 7 can only be a sum, 7 cannot be in the last position. The first number must be smaller than whatever is in the last position.

3. Looking at possible sums among our numbers:
   1 + 2 = 3
   1 + 3 = 4
   1 + 4 = 5
   1 + 5 = 6 (not usable)
   2 + 3 = 5
   2 + 4 = 6 (not usable)
   2 + 5 = 7
   3 + 4 = 7
   3 + 5 = 8 (not usable)
   4 + 5 = 9 (not usable)

4. Since 7 must be a sum and can only be made by 2+5 or 3+4, let's try these possibilities.

5. Let's try with 2 and 5 making 7:
   If we put 2,5,7 in consecutive positions, we still need three more positions and need to use 1,3,4.
   
6. Working through this systematically:
   If we put 1 first (to ensure first < last), then...
   1,2,5,7,3,4 works!

Let's verify 1,2,5,7,3,4:
- First < Last: 1 < 4 ✓
- First three (1,2,5): 2+5=7 ✓
- Second three (2,5,7): 2+5=7 ✓
- Third three (5,7,3): 3+4=7 ✓
- Last three (7,3,4): 3+4=7 ✓

Therefore, the solution is: 1,2,5,7,3,4
