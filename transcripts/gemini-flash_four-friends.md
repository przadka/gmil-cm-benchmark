### 5. Four Friends

Anna, Bartosz, Cezary, and Danuta are four friends. Each of them is preparing for a specific profession: archaeologist, bookkeeper, carpenter, and dentist. It is known that Bartosz will be a dentist. Only one of these people is training for a profession that starts with the same letter as their name, and that person is **not** Anna.

**What professions did Anna and Danuta choose?**

<ASSISTANT>
Here's how we can solve this logic puzzle:

1. **Bartosz is a dentist:** This is our starting point.

2. **Only one person's profession starts with the same letter as their name:**  We know this person isn't Anna.

3. **Consider the initial letters:**
   * Anna: A
   * Bartosz: B
   * Cezary: C
   * Danuta: D
   * Archaeologist: A
   * Bookkeeper: B
   * Carpenter: C
   * Dentist: D

4. **Eliminate matches:** Since only one person's profession matches their name's initial letter, and it's not Anna, we can eliminate the following:
   * Anna cannot be an archaeologist.
   * Bartosz is already a dentist.
   * Cezary cannot be a carpenter.
   * Danuta cannot be a dentist.

5. **Consider Bartosz again:**  Since Bartosz is a dentist, and only one person's profession starts with the same letter as their name, no one else can have a profession that starts with the same letter as their name.

6. **Deduce Danuta's profession:** Danuta cannot be a dentist.  Since Anna can't be an archaeologist, and Cezary can't be a carpenter, the only remaining option for Danuta must be archaeologist.

7. **Deduce Anna's profession:** Since Bartosz is a dentist, Danuta is an archaeologist, and Cezary cannot be a carpenter, Anna must be a carpenter.

8. **Deduce Cezary's profession:** The only remaining profession is bookkeeper, so Cezary must be a bookkeeper.

**Therefore:**

* **Anna is training to be a carpenter.**
* **Danuta is training to be an archaeologist.**
