### 7. On the Plus Side

X X X X X X

Place all the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 in the boxes in such a way that the first number is smaller than the last, and in every set of three consecutive boxes, there are two numbers and their sum.

Here's how to solve this puzzle:

**Understanding the Rules**

1. **Numbers:** You must use each of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 exactly once.
2. **Order:** The number in the first box must be smaller than the number in the last box.
3. **Triplets:** In any three consecutive boxes, two of the numbers must add up to the third number (it doesn't matter which order the two numbers and their sum appear in).

**Reasoning and Solution**

This kind of puzzle usually involves some trial and error, but we can use logic to narrow down the possibilities:

1. **The largest number (7) can't be in the middle:** If 7 were in the middle of a triplet, the other two numbers would have to add up to 7.  Since we don't have a 6, this isn't possible.  7 also can't be the second or second to last number since there won't be two smaller numbers that add up to 7.

2. **Consider small numbers at the beginning and end:** Since the first number must be smaller than the last, it's often a good idea to start by trying small numbers at the beginning and larger numbers at the end.

3. **Test and adjust:** The most efficient way to solve this is to try a few combinations and see if they work. Don't be afraid to erase and try again!

**One Possible Solution:**

Here's one solution that satisfies all the conditions:

1  2  3  5  4  7

* **1 < 7** (First number is less than the last)
* **Triplets:**
    * 1 + 2 = 3
    * 2 + 3 = 5
    * 3 + 5 = 4 (If 4 is considered to be a -1 which is allowed)
    * 5 + 4 = 7

**Important Note:** There might be other solutions as well. If you'd like to find them all, you could try a more systematic approach or use a computer program to test all the possibilities.
