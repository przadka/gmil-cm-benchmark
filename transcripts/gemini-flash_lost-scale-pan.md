## 6. The Lost Scale Pan

Robert lost the right pan of his balance scale and had to use a different one â€” slightly heavier than the original. Now, with empty pans, his scale does not show balance.

However, Robert noticed that when he places a full bottle of juice on the right pan and 9 identical empty bottles on the left pan, the scale is balanced.

The same happens when Robert places two empty bottles on the right pan and a bottle filled halfway with juice on the left pan.

**How many times heavier is the full bottle of juice compared to an empty bottle?**

<ASSISTANT>
Here's how to solve this problem:

**Let:**

* 'x' be the weight of the original right pan.
* 'x + k' be the weight of the new, heavier right pan (where 'k' is the extra weight).
* 'b' be the weight of an empty bottle.
* 'j' be the weight of the juice in a full bottle.

**Set up the equations based on the given information:**

* **Equation 1 (Full bottle on the right, 9 empty bottles on the left):**  9b + x = j + b + x + k  =>  8b = j + k
* **Equation 2 (Half-full bottle on the left, 2 empty bottles on the right):** j/2 + b + x = 2b + x + k  => j/2 = b + k

**Solve for j in terms of b:**

From Equation 2, we can express k as: k = j/2 - b

Substitute this value of k into Equation 1:

8b = j + (j/2 - b)
8b = 3j/2 - b
9b = 3j/2
18b = 3j
j = 6b

**Answer:**

The full bottle of juice (j) is 6 times heavier than an empty bottle (b).
