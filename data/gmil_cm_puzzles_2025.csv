lost-scale-pan,The Lost Scale Pan,"## 6. The Lost Scale Pan

Robert lost the right pan of his balance scale and had to use a different one â€” slightly heavier than the original. Now, with empty pans, his scale does not show balance.

However, Robert noticed that when he places a full bottle of juice on the right pan and 9 identical empty bottles on the left pan, the scale is balanced.

The same happens when Robert places two empty bottles on the right pan and a bottle filled halfway with juice on the left pan.

**How many times heavier is the full bottle of juice compared to an empty bottle?**"

Pola has a pair of plush monsters: a three-headed Cerberus and a two-headed Dragon. She really enjoys playing with these plush toys by putting hats on their heads.
